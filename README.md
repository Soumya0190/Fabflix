    ## Deployment Instructions
In order to deploy the project to Tomcat, follow below 

(1) Navigate to the **bin** directory of Tomcat and run **./startup.sh**. 
This ensures that the Tomcat server is running. 

(2) Clone the project into your choice of directory. 
This project has 2 directories inside, the AndroidApp directory for android project, and the 
WebApp directory for the web application. 

**----------- To Run The Web Application ---------**

(3) Navigate to the WebApp directory, in which **pom.xml** is located. 

(4) Run **mvn clean package** to generate the **.war** file, which will be created within the target directory. 

(5) Copy this war file to the **webapps** directory of Tomcat using 
**cp ./target/*.war /PATH_TO_TOMCAT/webapps** (i.e. home/ubuntu/tomcat/webapps).

(6) Run the following links on the browser to connect to the different instances

   - #### Explain how Connection Pooling is utilized in the Fabflix code.
1. For Fabflix, I have added added connection pool settings in resources in context.xml  
2. for slaveDB (read operations), I have used resource name = jdbc/moviedb
<Resource name="jdbc/moviedb"
          auth="Container"
          driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
          factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
          type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
          username="mytestuser"
          password="mypassword"
          url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/moviedb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false&amp;cachePrepStmts=true" />
3. for masterDB (insert/update operations), I am using jdbc/masterdb 
<Resource name="jdbc/masterdb"
          auth="Container"
          driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
          factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
          type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
          username="mytestuser"
          password="mypassword"
          url="jdbc:mysql://172.31.24.250:3306/moviedb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false&amp;cachePrepStmts=true"/>


2. The following changes are made to the servlets where JDBC connection is used
Context initContext = new InitialContext();
Context envContext = (Context) initContext.lookup("java:/comp/env"); 
DataSource ds = (DataSource) envContext.lookup("jdbc/moviedb");
Connection connection = ds.getConnection();

By adding connection poolingÂ , connections are reused rather than created each time a connection is requested. 
Connection pooling is performed in the background and does not affect how an application is coded; however, 
the application must use a DataSource object to obtain a connection instead of using the DriverManager class. 
The lookup returns a connection from the pool if one is available. in my configuration, there are 100 connection in connection pool, 
max idle connections are 30, i have added autoconnect=true.
The closing event on a pooled connection signals the pooling module to place the connection back in the connection pool for future reuse.



    - #### Explain how Connection Pooling works with two backend SQL.
    
The Master-Slave configuration is implemented in MySQL. 
Master allows read and write operations while the slave aloows only read operation. 
Used two AWS VM Servers with Tomcat and Mysql server running on each of them. 
The Connection pooling helps managing the connections to the database more efficiently.

    - #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of routing queries to Master/Slave SQL.
The following below files were changed for read-only slave master

    - #### How read/write requests were routed to Master/Slave SQL?
  I have created two resources, for read only operations, resource for slave is used and for write/update masterdb resource is used
    resource moviedb is for slave DB
    <Resource name="jdbc/moviedb"
          auth="Container"
          driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
          factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
          type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
          username="mytestuser"
          password="mypassword"
          url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/moviedb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false&amp;cachePrepStmts=true" />
3. for masterDB (insert/update operations), I am using jdbc/masterdb 
<Resource name="jdbc/masterdb"
          auth="Container"
          driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
          factory="org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSourceFactory"
          type="javax.sql.DataSource"
          maxTotal="100" maxIdle="30" maxWaitMillis="10000"
          username="mytestuser"
          password="mypassword"
          url="jdbc:mysql://172.31.24.250:3306/moviedb?autoReconnect=true&amp;useSSL=false&amp;cachePrepStmts=true"/>
 
- # JMeter TS/TJ Time Logs
    - #### Instructions of how to use the `log_processing.*` script to process the JMeter logs.
    I have copied all Jmeter logs and renamed files for each case
    I have created "ParseLogFile" Servlet that read all the files from the folder where all log files are saved. 
    I have written code to read each file and extracted below data
    	1. servlet execution time for getting movie results for each request (start-time is added as first line of servlet code(doGet) and endTime is recorded in the end of servlet code 
   	2. JDBC execution time(start-time is recorded when database connection is opened and end-time is recorded when connection is closed (for each request))
    After extracting above data, I have added calculated below data:
   	 1. Average TS : added  servlet execution time of all the records/requests and divided by total number of requests
   	 2. Average TJ : added JDBC execution time of all the records/requests and divided by total number of requests
 
 The parsing script was exceuted by running the command ** mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=main.java.ParseLogFile **
 And alternate way of running the ParseLogFile is on IntelliJ

| Case 1: HTTP/1 thread                          | log_processing_single_cp_1.txt  | 100 ms                     | 7,540,362 ms                       | 6,271,671 ms              | Amongst all of the calculated times, these times are the largest and slowest. This is because the single instance execution time is not as fast as the execution time for the load balancers, due to the single instance having only 1 tomcat instance handling all the requests solo. In addition, this case has the single thread for the single instance. Within the instance, having only 1 thread handling all the reuqests will take much longer than having 10 threads handling the requests together.             |
| Case 2: HTTP/10 threads                        | log_processing_single_cp_10.txt   |  235 ms                     | 7,876,373 ms                        | 6,616,776 ms              | 10 threads were faster than having 1 thread, and connection pooling is faster than no connection pooling           |
| Case 3: HTTPS/10 threads                       | log_processing_https.txt   | 203 ms                          | 9,5902,816 ms                        | 6,991,626 ms              | HTTPS with connection pooling and 10 threads is slower than HTTP with connection pooling and 10 threads. This is because security enabled, there is a SSL handshake at connection level that results in execution cost and makes it little slower than HTTP.            |
| Case 4: HTTP/10 threads/No connection pooling  | log_processing_single_ncp_10.txt  | 611 ms                    | 113,727,073,886 ms                    | 7,987,877 ms                 | As can be seen from times, on the single instance, no connection pooling with 10 threads was slower than having 10 threads with connection pooling           |
